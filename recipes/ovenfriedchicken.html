    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I love fried chicken, but it takes so long and is such a big mess.</p>
    <p>I came up with this oven-fried version, and have been making it ever since! Everyone I have given the recipe to has loved it as well.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12 chicken thighs</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>Â½ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li> Place flour in a shallow plate or bowl and season with salt and pepper to taste. Put bread crumbs in another shallow plate or bowl and beat eggs in another bowl.</li>
        <li> Dredge chicken piece by piece in the flour, then the egg, then the bread crumbs, until all pieces are coated.</li>
        <li> Pour oil into a large baking dish; add the breaded chicken thighs and sprinkle with paprika to taste. </li>
        <li> Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, then turn pieces over and bake for another 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and drain on paper towels.  </li>
        <li> Serve hot and enjoy! </li>
    </ol>
